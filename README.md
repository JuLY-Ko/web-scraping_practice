# web-scraping_practice

This project involves practicing web scraping using Python. I worked on scraping job listings from two different types of websites: a static website, We Work Remotely, and a dynamic website, Wanted.

Initially, the goal was to scrape only the dynamic website. However, as I progressed, I found it interesting and decided to challenge myself by also scraping the static website.

## Technologies Used

BeautifulSoup: A library for parsing HTML and XML documents.
Requests: A simple HTTP library for Python.
Key Learnings

Scraping Multiple Pages: I learned how to scrape multiple pages that contain the same type of information.
Handling Website Restrictions: I discovered simple methods to bypass restrictions when a website blocks access to web scraping.
Web Scraping Framework: I gained a better understanding of the structure and framework of web scraping.
## Project Overview

Static Website: We Work Remotely

We Work Remotely is a static website where job listings are easily accessible without much interaction or dynamic content loading. Scraping this site involved straightforward HTML parsing with BeautifulSoup and making HTTP requests using the Requests library.

Dynamic Website: Wanted

Wanted is a dynamic website, meaning it loads content dynamically via JavaScript. Scraping this site was more challenging and required handling dynamic content loading. This involved more sophisticated techniques to ensure all necessary data was scraped.
